                    <p>On 30th June 2005, Spain took a historic step by legalising same-sex marriage, becoming the third country in the world to do so after the Netherlands in 2001 and Belgium in 2003. This progressive move was a testament to Spain's rapid sociopolitical transformation, especially given its conservative past under the dictatorship of Franco. The legislation not only granted same-sex couples the right to marry but also the right to adopt children. While the decision was met with considerable support from the public, it faced opposition from conservative groups and the Roman Catholic Church. Nevertheless, the bill passed in the Spanish Parliament with a majority of 187–147, taking effect three days later. Another significant event was the Live 8 concerts. Live 8, a series of benefit concerts, took place in cities around the world on 2nd July 2005. It had one unified aim: to promote global awareness about the need for aid in Africa. Spearheaded by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, creators of the original Live Aid concerts in 1985, Live 8 was strategically timed to coincide with the G8 summit being held in Scotland. The goal was to pressure world leaders to commit to increasing aid, cancelling third-world debt, and promoting fair trade. The concerts took place in 10 venues across the world. One notable, horrific event that also occurred was the suicide bombings in London, 2005. The 7th July 2005 London bombings – known as 7/7 – were a series of coordinated suicide attacks on London's public transport system during the morning rush hour. Also in 2005 was the deadly Hurricane Katrina in the U.S. Hurricane Katrina, of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, was the costliest – and one of the deadliest hurricanes – in the history of the United States. Of the recorded Atlantic hurricanes, it was sixth strongest overall. (futuretimeline.net) </p>
