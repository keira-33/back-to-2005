            For this website I plan on making a website that will resemble a time capsule for the year I was born
            (2005). I plan to cover different aspects from the year such as world events, pop culture, and technology.
            The world events page will cover content like major (political, economic, etc.) events, “firsts” that
            happened, or other important facts. The pop culture page will cover content like popular music, TV/films,
            social media, and more. The technology page will cover innovations in computers/phones, new apps or
            websites, and more.
        </p>
