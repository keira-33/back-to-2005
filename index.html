                    <p>As of the creation of this project, twenty years have passed since 2005. A lot has changed in the past two decades, and many aspects of societies around the world have been changed by political, economic, technological, and social developments. This project looks to reflect on these changes through a sort of time capsule for the year 2005. This time capsule will reference global events, however this time capsule focuses largely on the U.S. perspective. There are three main categories of exploration: technology, popular culture, and world events, which explore aspects from the variations of  prices over the years to the evolution of social media platforms. This project was created as a final project for my CSC102 Web Development class, where the focus was on web development instead of content. (Almost none of the text is my own, but sources are provided, and none of the pictures are my own.) Some major events that occurred in 2005 can be seen in the background of the header: the launch of Google Maps, the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, the Live 8 benefit concerts, the launch of a Huygens probe on the surface of Saturn's largest moon, the launch of Youtube, an Apple conference, and the death of Pope John Paul II. Please read on to learn more about this exciting, transformative year.</p>

                    <p>A lot has happened in the 20 years since 2005. Some notable events and trends include COVID-19, the escalation of climate change, and the development of new technologies like artificial intelligence (AI). The UNFPA under the UN has done a lot of work on the changes that have occurred in the past two decades. One of the significant changes is that the proportion of people living in extreme poverty has been cut nearly in half – but economic inequality is now growing. The proportion of people living on less than $1.25 per day has fallen from 47 per cent in 1990 to 22 percent in 2010. But growing inequality could undermine these gains. Also, more children are attending school than ever – and the largest gains have been among girls. Primary school enrolment rates have jumped from around three quarters in 1990 to about 90 per cent in 2010. This is an especially huge victory for girls, who have gained parity in primary school enrolment in a majority of countries. But gender inequalities in education persist, with girls lagging behind boys in secondary school enrolment. The world is also increasingly urban. The global urban population rose by 1.6 billion between 1994 and 2014. More than half the world’s people now live in towns or cities. But too much of this growth is taking place in slums. Over 650 million people lived in slums in 1990. In 2010, that number was 820 million. Impoverished urban women and girls are especially vulnerable: they are less likely to have access to reproductive health services, education and security. Finally, the world now has the largest generation of young people ever. (social.desa.un.org)
